    "Owing to its location, the 2.5 acre site, with a slope of almost 15m across the site, has stunning views to the sea on the South, Melasti Beach, close to “Karma Kandara Resort”, making it an ideal location for high-end Residential Villas. \nThe design intent for the Master plan was to use the site slope to our advantage, by positioning Villas on two tiers, with a loop road connecting all the Villas. The orientation of the Villas is such that every Villa has uninterrupted sea views, from all the internal as well as external spaces. \nThe villas are planned such that they are accessed from the road, through a formal landscaped entrance, entering into a double height living room with views across to the lavish pool and rich landscape. The two floors are split vertically to accommodate the private spaces i.e. bedrooms on the upper level and semi- private spaces - living, dining and kitchen - on the lower level, opening onto a covered veranda. \nIn response to the sloping site, landscape for the villas is experiential and varied. The bedrooms have small but exclusive private/secret gardens on the upper level, internally detaching the car garage from the living spaces. The fromal entrance area leads us to an internal lobby and also connects to the lower garden level via a series of steps, flanked by dense plantation for privacy. The living/dining area on the lower level opens onto a covered lounge and bar-be-que area, extending further onto the pool side deck. The swimming pool with a vanishing edge detail and a stepped garden, offers magnificent views to the sea. \nThe design vocabulary for the development is dynamic and contemporary, with clearly delineated volumes. The facade is articulated by employing chamfered edges – creating an elegant external profile emphasizing the horizontality of the volumes, breaking the volumne with deep grooves. The modern yet timeless qualities of the development are enhanced by the sophisticated material palette that combines clear glazing, stucco system together with exposed concrete. With its prime location and cutting edge design, Hillside Villas development creates a new focal point, setting a new benchmark in terms of quality, exclusivity and visibility for the area.",
